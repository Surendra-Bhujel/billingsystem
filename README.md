# Electricity Billing

 A Java-based billing system that asks for each customer's name, house number, and units of electricity used. Based on  unit slabs (e.g. 10 units = Rs. 100, 20 units = Rs. 250, etc.), the program calculates the total bill for each customer. After processing 3–5 houses, it prints the bill for each total amount and customer name with the house number and identifies the highest paying customer along with their house number.

| Units Used (kWh) | Charge (Rs.) |
|------------------|--------------|
| 0 – 10           | 100          |
| 11 – 20          | 250          |
| 21 – 30          | 400          |
| 31 – 50          | 600          |
| 51 – 100         | 1000         |
| 101 – 200        | 1800         |
| 201 and above    | 2500+        |
